# TweetClassification
An old school project
The aim is to predict the location of twitter users using the tweets they generated. 

We learn to process text data using nltk and the n-gram model.
The baseline model used is the naive bayes classifier implemnented directly from sklearn APIs.
We then further improving the model by 
1) the use of random forest and other ensemble methods 
2) the use of embeddings generated from pretrained models (due to the lack of data, the embedding method does not work as well as we expected).
